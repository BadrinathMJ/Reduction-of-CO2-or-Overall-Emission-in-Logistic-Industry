# Reduction-of-CO2-or-Overall-Emission-in-Logistic-Industry
Reduction of CO2 Emission in Logistic Industry :There is a huge business opportunity in reduction of CO2  emission because after 1990 the increment in emission of CO2 has a bigger impact on climate change and global warming. But this issue is underrated in business and this era of cutting edge technology the monitoring and controlling of CO2 emission is easy with the help of different sensors.The dataset getting from this sources are analyzed through process of Data Cleaning and EDA and ML model can be prepared for the prediction of CO2 Emission which leads to take the remedial actions for the reduction of CO2 emission
